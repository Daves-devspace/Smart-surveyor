# 🛰️ Smart Surveyor System – 1 Week Project Plan

This document outlines a structured 7-day timeline to build and deploy the **Smart Surveyor Platform** with features like AI-based mutation mapping, offline mobile tools, secure access, and surveyor reporting — aligned with **UN SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**.

## 📅 Weekly Timeline Breakdown

| **Day** | **Focus Area** | **Core Tasks** | **Outcome** |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | 🔧 Project Setup & Models | - Django project + app setup<br>- Create `LayoutProject` & `SurveyorPoint` models<br>- User auth system<br>- Base templates & map viewer | ✅ Project creation & basic dashboard working |
| **Day 2** | 🗺️ Interactive Map Drawing | - Integrate Leaflet.js + drawing tools<br>- Save/edit shapes as GeoJSON<br>- Handle frontend map interaction<br>- Style & layout improvements | ✅ Users can draw and save plot layouts |
| **Day 3** | 🧠 AI Layout Generator | - Upload form: mutation area + plot specs<br>- Run Genetic Algorithm to generate layout<br>- Show live preview on map<br>- Export DXF/GeoJSON | ✅ Auto-generate sub-plots with AI |
| **Day 4** | 📱 Mobile View + Offline | - Add GPS tracking (blue dot)<br>- Distance display between points<br>- Leaflet offline tile cache<br>- IndexedDB for offline points | ✅ Works smoothly on mobile, offline support added |
| **Day 5** | 🔒 Secure Sharing & QR | - Generate shareable URL + QR code<br>- Add PIN-protected map access<br>- Render PIN prompt on public access<br>- Mobile-friendly map loading | ✅ Secure links via QR + PIN verification |
| **Day 6** | 📄 Export & Reporting | - Export map + metadata to PDF<br>- Create admin dashboard: points, distance, surveyor<br>- Sync button for offline data<br>- Basic admin filters | ✅ Field reports + exports & admin tools working |
| **Day 7** | 🧪 Testing & Deployment | - Write unit tests (area match, PIN auth)<br>- Final UI polish<br>- Responsive CSS tweaks<br>- Finalize README + deployment prep | ✅ Production-ready, documented & stable build |

## 📊 Metrics Captured

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| 📍 Points Marked | `SurveyorPoint` logs |
| 🧭 Distance Walked | Haversine distance between points |
| ⏱️ Time Active | Timestamps on logs |
| 📈 Surveyor Performance | Aggregated per user/project |

---

## 🔐 Security

| Feature | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Project Ownership | Linked to `request.user` |
| PIN Access | URL param required for public access |
| QR Code Entry | Generated per project |
| Auth Pages | Django built-in `LoginRequiredMixin` |

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements (Post Week 1)
